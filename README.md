`nectan` is meant to be a sort of utilities do deal with SC2 galaxy script. It can parse it into AST structure.  
Currently it exposes 2 functionalities: code linting and obfuscation.

Source code of this package is somewhat messy.. as it was my training ground for learning python and understanding principles of building an AST.
